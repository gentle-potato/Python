yesterday
all my troubles seemed so far away
now it looks as though they're here to stay
oh, i believe in yesterday
suddenly
i'm not half the man i used to be
there's a shadow hanging over me
oh, yesterday came suddenly
why she had to go? i don't know
she wouldn't say
i said something wrong
now i long for yesterday
yesterday
love was such an easy game to play
now i need a place to hide away
oh, i believe in yesterday
why she had to go? i don't know
she wouldn't say
i said something wrong
now i long for yesterday
yesterday
love was such an easy game to play
now i need a place to hide away
oh, i believe in yesterday
